  </h2>Whatchu Say Lyrics by Jason Derulo</h2>
<body>
  <ol>
  <p> <li>I (I) was so <b>wrong</b> for so&nbsp;long
Only tryna please myself (Myself)
    Girl, I (I) was caught up (Up) in her lust (Lust)<br>
    <hr> <li>When <em>I dont really want no one else,</em> so no
    I know I shoulda <b>treated you better</b>
But me and you were meant to last forever So let me in (Let me in)
Give me another chance (Another chance)
<hr><li>To really be your man (Oh) <br> 'Cause when the roof caved in and the truth came out
I just didn't know what to do
But when I become a star, we'll be livin' so large
    <b>I'll do anything for you</b> So tell me, <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnOXjYootTM" /a> girl</p>
