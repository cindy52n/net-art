    <h3>Curatorial Statement</h3>
    <p>
      With all the different types of websites that can be used to express a person’s self-identity, or what they like, I’ve decided to choose these 6 websites! As you look through each one, it could inspire you to create your own for feature references. These six websites show a variety of do-it-yourself mentality, self-portraits, or a community of artists. Most importantly, all 6 of these websites show some type of cyber digital design to them, whether it be the images used, the fonts, or the whole website as a whole. 
    <br>You’ll first see how two websites on the left hand columns <b>(Elle’s, ToothLilli's)</b> are autobiographies of themselves. They include their interests, as well as their projects for everyone to explore. Next you have the middle column <b>(GoblinHeart, MelonLand)</b>, which are websites for discovery. Showing off different artists and their talents. Finally you have the two in the right columns <b>(Cameron’s, Tetrageddon)</b>, sites that display a more interactive portion. As you click through the sites, you're able to see different sights they display.
