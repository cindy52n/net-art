    <h3>Curatorial Statement</h3>
    <p>
      The internet is still being shaped as a platform for individual expression by a strong underneath of digital artists in a time when corporate social media and algorithm-driven interactions predominate. Through six unique websites that on their own bear tribute to the creativity, nostalgia, and do-it-yourself mentality of the early web resurgence, Digital Dreamscapes honors the spirit of independent web production. These websites exemplify the personalized look of the personal internet, from MelonLand, an interactive community supporting web-based art, to Goblin-Heart.net, a comfortable, ASCII-adorned cottage of digital discovery. Both ToothLilli's Pillowfort and Elle's Homepage are dynamic self-portraits of their authors that showcase their hobbies, projects, and online personas. Tetrageddon, a strange, interactive net-art playground, and Cameron's World, a vast mosaic of GeoCities artifacts, both honor the wild and unbridled inventiveness of early cyberspace.
