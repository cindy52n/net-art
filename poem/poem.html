Tell me that it's all just in my head <br>
Is it true we were never meant </p>
I know that this&nbsp;isn’t how it ends <br>
<em>Promise me this isn’t how it ends</em>
	
<ol>
Don’t tell me that its <li>gone, <li>gone, <li>gone, <li>gone, <li>gone
	</ol>
You’re still the one I want, want, want, want, want<br>
Underneath the stars, stars, stars, stars, stars
<br>
I’ll meet you where you are <br>
No matter where you are </br> 
Don’t tell me that its gone, gone, gone, gone, gone <br>
		<ul>
You’re still the one I <li>want, <li>want, <li>want, <li>want, <li>want
	</ul>
Underneath the stars, stars, stars, stars, stars
