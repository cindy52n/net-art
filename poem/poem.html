  Tell me that its all just in my head <br>
  Is it true we were never meant </p>
  I know that this&nbsp;isn’t how it ends <br>
  <em>Promise me this isn’t how it ends</em><br>

  Don’t tell me that its
  <ol>
    <li> gone,
    <li>gone,
    <li>gone,
    <li>gone,
    <li>gone
  </ol>

  You’re still the one <br>I want, want, want, want want
  <br>Underneath the stars, stars, stars, stars, stars
  <br>I’ll meet you where you are
  <br>No matter where you are
  <p>Don’t tell me that its gone, gone, gone, gone, gone</p>

  <ul>You’re still the one I
    <li>want ,
    <li>want,
    <li>want,
    <li>want
    <li>want
  </ul>

  Underneath the
  <h6>stars</h6>
  <h5>stars</h5>
  <h4>stars</h4>
  <h3>stars</h3>
  <h2>stars</h2>

  <p>I’ll meet you where you are<br>
    No matter where you are
  <p>

    I swear I’ve cried my heart out to pieces<br>
    Trying to make up stupid reasons<br>
    <em>Maybe it’s the devil I’m missing<br>
      Maybe he’ll allow me three wishes<p></em>
    Oh oh
  <p>
    Please don’t make me look at my phone<br>
    When you know <b>I’m alone</b><br>
    Oh oh I don’t need reminders of it all<br>
  <h3>I’ll meet you where you are <br>
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPPEQm112iY" /a>
      No matter where you are
