  </h3>Gone by niko rain & EJEAN</h3>
<body>
  
  <p> Tell me that its all just in my head</p>
Is it true we were never meant
I know that this isn’t how it ends
    <em>Promise me this isn’t how it ends</em>


Don’t tell me that its <ol> <li> gone, <li>gone, <li>gone, <li>gone, <li>gone </ol>
You’re still the one I want, want, want, want want
Underneath the stars, stars, stars, stars, stars
I’ll meet you where you are
No matter where you are
<p>Don’t tell me that its gone, gone, gone, gone, gone</p>
  <h4><b><ul>You’re still the one I <li>want , <li>want, <li>want, <li>want <li>want </b></h4></ul>
  Underneath the <h6>stars,<h/6> <h5>stars,</h5> <h4>stars,</h4> <h3>stars,</h3> <h2>stars</h2>
I’ll meet you where you are
No matter where you are


  I swear I’ve <b>cried my heart out to pieces</b>
Trying to make up stupid reasons
Maybe it’s the devil I’m missing
Maybe he’ll allow me three wishes
Oh oh
Please don’t make me look at my phone
When you know I’m alone
Oh oh I don’t need reminders of it all <hr><h3><b>I’ll meet you where you are <br><a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPPEQm112iY"/a>
No matter where you are </h3></b></hr></br>
